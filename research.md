I am undecided on a dissertation topic. But I have been reading literature to help me decide. Computer simulations, spatial statistics, under a Bayesian framework under the radar.

#### Literature That I am Reading:

- [Online Random Forests](/assets/litreview/orf.pdf)
- [Mondrian Forests](/assets/litreview/mondrian.pdf)
    - [Video Lecture by Teh](http://videolectures.net/sahd2014_teh_mondrian_forests/)
    - [Mondrian Forests for Large-Scale Regression when Uncertainty Matters](/assets/litreview/mondrianUncertainty.pdf)
    - [Mondrian Process in Machine Learning](/assets/litreview/mondrianML.pdf)
- [Air Flight Damages](/assets/litreview/airflightdamage.pdf)
- [Multi-objectice Optimization](/assets/litreview/optimAir.pdf)
- [Sea Surface Temperatures](/assets/litreview/sst.pdf)

My master's thesis at BYU (2013-2015) was [*Extending the Indian Buffet Process to include Distance Information*](/assets/misc/masterLui.pdf).
