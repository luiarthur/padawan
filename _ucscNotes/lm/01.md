Linear models
: $\Rightarrow$ linear in "parameters". That is 

$$
  y = f(X)\beta + \epsilon
$$

In linear models, least Squares = BLUE = MLE, for normal errors.

BLUE
: Best Linear Unbiased Estimator. $\hat\beta = (X'X)^-X'y$ are *linear* in $y$.

ANCOVA
: Analysis of Covariance. Mix of Regressions and ANOVA.
