LU decomposition and singular value decomposition (SVD) are both techniques for
solving systems of equations.  They both solve problems of the form $A \mathbf
x = b$, where $\mathbf x$ is the unknown. The difference is that SVD's can
handle matrices $A$ that are $m \times n$, whereas LU's can typically only
solve problems where $A$ is $n \times n$. Computationally, LU is simpler
than SVD.

## LU Decomposition
Every matrix $\underset{n \times n}{A}$ can be rewritten as $A=LU$, where $L$
and $U$ are lower and upper traingulars respectively. That is 
$$ L = \left[
  \begin{array}{lll}
    1     &     0 & 0 \\\\
    L\_{11} &     1 & 0 \\\\
    L\_{21} & L\_{32} & 1 \\\\
  \end{array}
\right] $$

$$ U = \left[
  \begin{array}{lll}
    U\_{11} &  U\_{12} & U\_{13} \\\\
          0 &  U\_{22} & U\_{23} \\\\
          0 &        0 & U\_{33} \\\\
  \end{array}
\right] $$

Solving for the values of $L$ and $U$ is trivial. The key of the LU decomp
is noticing that $A\mathbf x = b \Rightarrow LU \mathbf x = b$.
This means that we can first solve for $\mathbf y$ in $L\mathbf y = b$ where
$y = U\mathbf x$, and then solve for $\mathbf x$ in $U\mathbf x = \mathbf y$.
