### Functions
- **Analytic Functions** are single valued and differentiable in a region $R$ 
  except at a finite (and possibly countable) number of singularities. Analytic 
  complex functions are awesome.
- $z = x + iy = re^{i\theta}$
- $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$
- $e^{i\pi} = -1$
- $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$
- $z^n = 1 \Rightarrow e^{i\theta n} = 1~(\because |z^n| = 1) \Rightarrow z=e^{2\pi ik/n}, k = 0,1,2,...,n-1$ 
- A complex function $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is analytic $\iff \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$
  and $\displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$
- **Power series** in complex plane: $f(z) = \displaystyle\sum\_{n=0}^\infty a\_n z^n$
- **Raidus of convergence** $R = \displaystyle\lim\_{n \rightarrow \infty} |a\_n|^{-1\n}$. $R=0,\infty \Rightarrow$ convergence at origin and everywhere respectively.

### Integrals
- **Line Integrals** $\displaystyle\int_\gamma~f(z) ~dz$
    - If we think of an integral as the area under a cruve, then in the above
      (complex) line integral the curve would go along the path $\gamma$ (on
      the real-complex / x-y plane) having the height of $f(z)$ along the path;
      and the area would be not a flat surface, but a **curvy curtain** (or a
      fence) under the curve $\left\\{f(z=x+iy) : (x,y) \in \gamma\right\\}$.
      Real line integrals can be thought of in a similar way.
- **Cauchy's Theorem**: $\displaystyle\oint_C~f(z)~dz=0$ if $f$ is analytic in $z$ and $f'$ is continuous in $z$. (Proved using Green's Theorem.)
- **Cauchy's Integral Formula**: $f(z\_0) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint\_C~\frac{f(z)}{z-z\_0}~dz$, for $f$ analytic anywhere in a closed contour $C$.
    - $f^{(n)}(z\_0) = \displaystyle\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\oint\_C~\frac{f(z)}{(z-z\_0)^{n+1}}~dz$
- **Cauchy's Inequality**
- **Taylor Series**
- **Laurent Series**
- **Residue**
