### Functions
- **Analytic Functions** are single valued and differentiable in a region $R$ 
  except at a finite (and possibly countable) number of singularities. Analytic 
  complex functions are awesome.
- $z = x + iy = re^{i\theta}$
- $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$
- $e^{i\pi} = -1$
- $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$
- $z^n = 1 \Rightarrow e^{i\theta n} = 1~(\because \abs{z^n} = 1) \Rightarrow z=e^{2\pi ik/n}, k = 0,1,2,...,n-1$ 
- A complex function $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is analytic $\iff \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$
  and $\displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$
- **Power series** in complex plane: $f(z) = \displaystyle\sum\_{n=0}^\infty a\_n z^n$
- **Radius of convergence** $R = \displaystyle\lim\_{n \rightarrow \infty} \abs{a\_n}^{-1/n}$. $R=0,\infty \Rightarrow$ convergence at origin and everywhere respectively.

### Integrals
- **Line Integrals** $\displaystyle\int_\gamma~f(z) ~dz$
    - If we think of an integral as the area under a cruve, then in the above
      (complex) line integral the curve would go along the path $\gamma$ (on
      the real-complex / x-y plane) having the height of $f(z)$ along the path;
      and the area would be not a flat surface, but a **curvy curtain** (or a
      fence) under the curve $\left\\{f(z=x+iy) : (x,y) \in \gamma\right\\}$.
      Real line integrals can be thought of in a similar way.
- **Cauchy's Theorem**: $\displaystyle\oint_C~f(z)~dz=0$ if $f$ is analytic in $z$ and $f'$ is continuous in $z$. (Proved using Green's Theorem.)
- **Cauchy's Integral Formula**: $f(z\_0) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint\_C~\frac{f(z)}{z-z\_0}~dz$, for $f$ analytic anywhere in a closed contour $C$.
    - $f^{(n)}(z\_0) = \displaystyle\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\oint\_C~\frac{f(z)}{(z-z\_0)^{n+1}}~dz$
- **Cauchy's Inequality**: Suppose that $f(z)$ is analytic *inside and on* a circle $C$ of radius $R$ centered at $z=z\_0$. 
  Then if $|f(z)| \le M$ on the circle, where $M$ is some constant, then $|f^{(n)}(z\_0)| \le \displaystyle\frac{Mn!}{R^n}$.
- **Taylor Series**: If $f(z\_0)$ is analytic,  
  $f(z) = \displaystyle\sum\_{n=0}^\infty a\_n(z-z\_0)^n = \displaystyle\sum\_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(z\_0)}{n!}(z-z\_0)^n$
- **Laurent Series**: If $f$ has a singularity at $z\_0$, the Taylor series cannot be written. Instead, you can write the 
  Laurent series:  
  $\displaystyle{\frac{a\_{-p}}{(z-z\_0)^p} +...+ \frac{a\_{-1}}{z-z\_0}} + a\_0 + a\_1(z-z\_0) + a\_2(z-z\_0)^2 +...$,  
  for $a\_{-p} \ne 0$ and $f(z)$ has pole of order $p$ at $z\_0$.
- **Essential Singularity**:??? 
- **Residue**: If $f(z)$ has pole of order $m$ at $z=z\_0$, then (by considering the Laurent Series) 
  the residue $R(z\_0) = a\_{-1} = \displaystyle\lim\_{z\rightarrow z\_0}\left\\{ \frac{1}{m!} \frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}}[(z-z\_0)^mf(z)] \right\\}$.

- **Residue Theorem**: if $f(z)$ is continuous and analytic in a closed contour $C$ except at a finite number of poles within $C$, $\mathbf{z\_0}$, then    
  $\displaystyle\oint\_C~f(z)~dz= 2\pi i \sum\_{z\_0 \in \mathbf{z\_0}} R(z\_0)$.  
  Note that when $f(z)$ is analytic, there are no poles, so the sum of the
  residues is $0$ and we get Cauchy's Theorem.

### Other Theorems
1. If $f(z)$ has poles as its only singularities inside a closed contour $C$ and is not zero at any point on $C$ then  
   $\displaystyle\oint\frac{f^\prime(z)}{f(z)}~dz = 2\pi i \sum\_j (N\_j - P\_j)$,  
   where $N\_j$ is the order of the $j^{th}$ zero of $f(z)$ enclosed by $C$ and $P\_j$ is the
   order of the $j^{th}$ pole of $f(z)$ inside $C$.
2. If $f(z)$ is analytic inside $C$ and not zero at any point on it then  
   $2\pi \sum\_j N\_j = \Delta_C[arg~f(z)] $,  
   where $\Delta\_C[x]$ denotes the variation in $x$ around the contour $C$.
3. **Rouche's theorem**: If $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic within and on a closed contour $C$ and
   $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ on $C$ then $f(z)$ and $f(z) + g(z)$ have the same number of zeros
   inside $C$.
