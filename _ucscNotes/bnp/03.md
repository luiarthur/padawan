## [Definition](/assets/ams241/02/notes-stoch-processes.pdf)
Consider a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, where $\Omega$ is the sample
space of the experiment, an index set $T$, and a state space $S$. A stochastic
process (SP) is a collection
$$
  \mathcal X = \\{ X(\omega,t): \omega \in \Omega, t\in T \\}
$$
such that:

1.  For any $n$ and any set of index points $t\_i \in T, i = 1,...,n,
    (X\_{t\_1} , ..., X\_{t\_n})$ is an $n$-dimensional random variable (random
    vector) defined on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ and
    taking values in $S^n \equiv S \times ... \times S$. 
    - Hence, for each fixed $t\_i \in T$, $X\_{t\_i}(\cdot) \equiv X(\cdot,
      t\_i) : (\Omega, \mathcal F, P) \rightarrow S$ is a random variable (or is
      it a [random function](http://stat.math.uregina.ca/~kozdron/Teaching/Regina/862Winter06/Handouts/revised_lecture1.pdf)?).

2.  For any fixed $\omega \in \Omega$, $X\_\omega(\cdot) \equiv X(\omega, \cdot):
    T \rightarrow S$ is a function defined on $T$ and taking values in $S$,
    referred to as a sample (or **sample path** or **realization**) of the stochastic
    process $\mathcal X$.

### What does this mean?
This means that the stochastic process $\mathcal X$ can be viewed as

1. a collection of random *functions* $\\{ X_\omega: \omega \in \Omega \\}$, by fixing $t$
2. a collection of random *variables* $\\{ X_t: t \in T \\}$, by fixing $\omega$

Note that $\omega$ *is not* a parameter. It is instead an element from the sample space
$\Omega$. The $\omega$ is the input to the function $X$ while $t$ is the realization
index (or in a time series problem, time).

The Gaussian Process (GP) and Dirichlet Process (DP) are therefore SP's.
