Markov Chain
: A Markov Chain is a sequence of random variables $$x_1,x_2,...$$ defined on a probability space such that 

$$
  P(X_t \in A \v X_{t-1},\cdots,X_{1}) = P(X_t \in A \v X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})
$$

(depending on only the previous draw). MC's are defined in terms of transition (proposal) kernel $\kappa$ such that $\forall x\in\Omega,~\kappa(x,.)$ is a probability measure.

Time Homogeneous Chain
: A markov chain such that the transition kernel is the same $\forall t$.

When $\Omega$ is discrete, $$[P]_{x,y} = P(X_t = y \v X_{t-1} = x)$$.

If $\Omega$ is continuous: $$P(X_t \in A \v X_{t-1} = x) = \int_A \kappa(x,x') dx'$$

Assuming $\Omega$ discrete and finite, with $S$ possibile states, $\pi_t = (\pi_{t,1}, ..., \pi_{t,s})'$ (the marginal at time $t$) and $\pi_{t,1}$ being the probability of being at state 1 at time $t$.

$\pi_{t+1}' = \pi_t'P$, $P$ is the transition kernel.

$\pi_{t+k}' = \pi_t'P^k$.

An MC has a stationary distribution $\tilde\pi$ if $\tilde\pi'=\tilde\pi'P$. (Review applied math class)

An MC ($\Omega$ countable) has a unique stationary distribution iff the chain is irreducible and positive recurrent.

Irreducible
: A chain is irreducible if $\forall$ pairs of states $i,j$, we can find $n_{i,j}, n_{j,i}$ such that

$$
\begin{cases}
  P(X_{n_{i,j}}=j\v X_1=i) \gt 0 \\
  P(X_{n_{j,i}}=i\v X_1=j) \gt 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

Positive Recurrent
: A state $i$ is positive recurrent if the time it takes to returning to a state is finite.
