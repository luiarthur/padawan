1. Updating Bayesian regression
2. Quick way to get posterior means
3. Indian Buffet Process (IBP) in relation to Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
4. BNP Logistic Regression

- From a *practical* perspective, Bayesian methods are used only when *uncertainty* is of interest. If the practitioner is only interested point estimation, frequentist methods are preferred.
