## Global Local

- computationally easy
- generally no mixing issues (unlike spike and slab)

## Bayesian Lasso prior (Park and Casella, 2008)

- bayesian adaptation of frequntist lasso
- choose $\lambda$ using empirical bayes
- Inverse-Gaussian distribution is not a obtained by taking the reciprocal of a gaussian! Misnomer.
