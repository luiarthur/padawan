## Sparsity based methods

The problem once again is inverting $G=(\sigma^2I+K)$ which is $n\times n$. This is $O(n^3)$. If we can strategically make $G$ sparse, we can invert the matrix in much less time.

Gneting (2001) proposed compactly supported kernels. Covariance between two points is zero if distance beyond a certain threshold.

$$
  \kappa(s,s') = \p{\brak{1-\frac{ \norm{s-s'}} {\nu}}_+}^4 \p{1+\frac{4\norm{s-s'}}{\nu}}
$$
