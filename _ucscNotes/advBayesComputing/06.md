###  Problems with SSVN

- Computational issues (large $p$ is a problem)
- Correlation among predictors, say $x\_1,x\_2,x\_3$ are highly correlated, then each of them will be included $1/3$ of the time, instead of including one of the predictors (if they're supposed to be included).
- SSVS not great for more than hundred of predictors
- Not appealing philosophically for a Bayesian


### Shrinkage Priors

- unimportant predictors shrunk to 0; important ones are kept.
- Laplace (Bayesian Lasso)
  - bad shrinkage prior: $f(x) \sim \exp^{-x}$
  - good shrinkage prior: $f(x) \sim a^{-x}$
- research started in 2005
- Polson & Scott (2010, 2012)


### [Global Local Representation](/assets/ams268/bayesReg.pdf)

- global parameter shrinks all coefficients to 0
- local parameter avoids over-shrinking
- Normal Means Problem
$$
\begin{matrix}
  y\_1 & = & \beta\_1 + \epsilon\_1 \\\\
  \vdots & = & \vdots \\\\
  y\_n & = & \beta\_n + \epsilon\_n \\\\
\end{matrix}
$$
