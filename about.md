I am a Statistics Ph.D. student advised by Juhee Lee at UC Santa Cruz. My
dissertation involves the application of Bayesian non-parametric methods to the
bio-sciences. My other interests include statistical computing and variational
inference.

My master's thesis at BYU (2013-2015) was [*Extending the Indian Buffet Process to include Distance Information*](/assets/misc/masterLui.pdf). I was advised by David B. Dahl.


I also have a deep love for classical and jazz piano music.
