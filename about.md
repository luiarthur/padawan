I grew up in Hong Kong and developed an interest for mathematics and a love
for classical music in high school.

In Brigham Young University - Hawaii (2007), I studied piano with Stacey
Mccarrey. Studying with Stacey has greatly influenced the way I play. I always
strive for the 'bell' sound she encouraged me to create.

After serving a 2-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints, I returned to BYUH to stuydy the piano for another year before
transfering to BYU Provo. At BYU, I eventually discovered a Statistics. I also
took several courses about jazz music and have adopted the style in my playing.

In my free time, I like to learn and have fun. I aim for a balanced life. I try
to spend time at the piano every day. I particularly enjoy the music of
Rachmaninoff and Bill Evans. Most mornings I rise and run. I try to avoid
spending time on school / work on the weekends to recharge and do things like
going to the movies, reading a novel, and being outdoors.
