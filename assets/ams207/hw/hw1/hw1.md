1. Obtain the mean and the variance for the beta-binomial distribution. Show that it tackles the overdispersion problem. Hint: use the formulas for conditional expectations and variances.
2. Obtain the Laplace approximation for the posterior expection of  logit(mu) and log(tau) in the cancer mortality rate example (data available from the package LearnBayes).
3. Obtain an expression for the posterior variance of the locatioin parameter of a normal likelihood as function of the predictive marginal density. This is an extension of what was shown in class for the posterior mean.
