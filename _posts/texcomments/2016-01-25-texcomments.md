title: Latex Enabled Commenting System
dollar: on

A while ago, I created [Cucumber][ref4], a simple commenting system built on
[Firebase][ref3]. I just discovered that simply adding **one line of javascript** 
would allow me me render latex code in my comments. 

Now **you** can type latex code in my comments. Try it out!

It's not perfect. For example, if you want to edit your latex code, you'll see
a bunch of unsolicited javascript... And of course, don't expect to type a
ridiculous amount in it, because that would be a pain to edit. Great for short
comments, in my opnion.

Instructions on adding cucumber to your website can be found [here][ref4].
