Well, I've finally started.

I've wanted a place to share my insights to coding
in statistics. At times, I would spend many hours
searching for answers to my questions in R, LaTeX,
linux, and recently, other languages. I enjoy
learning, and intend to continue learning more
about coding, in different environments. I think
there are many like me out there who just want to
get to the bottom of things quickly, and get a
bare bones understanding of things, without
learning every little detail. For those that do
want to learn everything, there are ample sites
for that. So, I hope to be able to keep up here,
and share my insights. We'll see if I can deliver,
or if this will just be another blog to fall by
the way-side.
