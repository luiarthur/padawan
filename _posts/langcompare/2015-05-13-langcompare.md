As a statistical package with a large support community R serves its purpose
well. However, at times, especially when doing more computation-heavy analysis,
R slows down and reaches memory limits. So, I've looked around for a language
that is reasonalbly fast, and quick to develop. Conciseness usually means less
room for coding errors and higher productivity. I tried out C++, Scala, and
Julia. (I also attempted C and Go, but soon realized the linear algebra
libraries were a pain to to grind through.) And since my computational work is
usually Bayesian, I created my own criteria for judging performance â€” a
standard Bayesian multiple linear regression algorithm.

\\[\begin{array}{rcl}
   y|\beta & \sim & Normal(X\beta,\sigma^2I) \\\\
     \beta & \sim & Normal(0,100(X'X)^{-1}) \\\\
  \sigma^2 & \sim & Gamma(1,1) \\\\
\end{array}\\]

The simulated data used for this study can be found at my
[github](https://github.com/luiarthur/progSpeedCompare/blob/master/data/dat.txt).

This simulation study is not meant to be an official benchmark. Sites such as
[computer language benchmark
games](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=scala&lang2=gpp)
do a more thourough job. Though, this study surely offers insights for those
that do computational statistics.


## Results
From the plots below, we can see that Julia seems to be fast and concise. I
found some things that were non-intuitive. Loading libraries takes a while, but
there are ways to [precompile
packages](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/uQfBNtJksRo).

I've included code at the bottom of this page.
